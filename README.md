# Non-Linear-Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) applied to three distinct engineering optimization problems as outlined in the project report from the "Non-Linear Optimization in Engineering" course.

## Project Description
- **Satellite System Optimization**: Reduces communication latency and maximizes coverage area for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites.
- **Online Service Profit Maximization**: Manages server requests efficiently to maximize profits and minimize response times.
- **Structural Optimization of a Ten-Bar Truss**: Minimizes the mass of a ten-bar truss while ensuring structural integrity.

## Key Features
- Use of the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm, a novel metaheuristic technique, to address complex optimization problems.
- Implementation in Python, emphasizing efficient data structures and algorithms to ensure performance.
- Extensive use of mathematical modeling to simulate and solve real-world engineering problems.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib for graphical outputs
